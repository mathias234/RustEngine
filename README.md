# RustEngine

Rust Engine is a 3D rendering framework written entierly in rust.
This project was mostly made as a project for learning rust.

# Features
- 3D graphics using [glium](https://github.com/glium/glium) as a backend
- A custom immidiate mode gui, using [rusttype](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype) for font rasterization
- Basic physics simulation (only cubes and spheres currently implemented) using [nphysics3d](https://nphysics.org/)


# TODO
- Improve the graphics pipeline
- Cleanup and improve the gui
- Add more functionality to the physics system
